    <p class="intro">
      All five boroughs saw a significant increase in composting since 2020. </p>
     <p>New York City residents have been required to separate food waste and yard trimmings from other trash since October 2024. But in April 2025, the Department of Sanitation began cracking down, issuing fines of up to $300 to certain property owners who didn't comply. As shown in the graph, the rate of composting increased by nearly 200% between March and April 2025.
	 </p>
	<p>
	  One week after the fines took effect, the City Council's Common Sense Caucus introduced a bill to roll back mandatory composting and make participation voluntary. Just a couple of weeks after enacting the fines, Mayor Adams paused them, saying that although composting was to remain mandatory, the enforcement would not resume until 2026.
	<p> Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani says the city needs to "fully follow through on the policies that we have," adding that there is "in general a fatigue with constantly changing policies in New York City and an inability to follow through on the policies we have." 
	</p>
	  <p> "Whether it be with composting or anything else, we need to actually follow through on the things that make so many New Yorkers proud to live in New York City," he said.</p>
