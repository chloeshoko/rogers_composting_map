    <p class="intro">
      New York City saw a huge increase in the separation of residential organic waste between March and April 2025, under threat of fines.  </p>
     <p> Brooklyn Community District 11, which includes Bath Beach, Bensonhurst, Gravesend and Mapleton, saw the biggest change, with a 1137% increase. </p>
	<p> New Yorkers have been required to separate organic waste (food scraps, compostable paper, yard trimmings) since October 2024; noncompliance fines of up to $300 were enacted in April 2025 (but were paused a few weeks later). The city is still issuing fines to buildings with over 30 tenants that have received four warnings. All other residential buildings are also required to comply, but warnings are only issued as an educational tool to remind people of the rule. Incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani signaled the city would follow through with the policy. </p>
